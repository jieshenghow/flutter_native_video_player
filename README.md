# Flutter Native Video Player

This project is a specialized Flutter plug-in package which enables developers to link video players from Android and
iOS native -- specifically, ExoPlayer for Android and AVKit player for iOS.

## Getting Started

To utilize this plugin, you need a starting point for a
Flutter [plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/). This particular package includes the
platform-specific implementation code necessary for ExoPlayer and AVKit player integration with your respective Android
or iOS application.

For those new to Flutter development, you can find an array of resources like tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile
development, and a complete API reference in the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).
